- a. Techno-Commercial Bid
- b. Quality Bid
- c. Price Bid
Bid Qualification Criterion and Technical Requirement as specified in Section 1.2 below, shall form part of the Techno-Commercial Bid of the tender.
Quality Bid (i.e. 2nd Part of the tender) of only those Bidders shall be opened who qualify in the Techno-Commercial Bid. Such bidders shall be required to make a presentation to obtain their Quality Score. For this purpose they may be required to come to BPCL's office or any other location in India as decided by BPCL.

Price bid (i.e. 3rd Part of the tender) of only those Bidders would be opened who obtain a Quality Score of at least 70 marks (out of a total of 100). BPCL will follow the Quality and Cost Based Selection Process (QCBS). The overall evaluation shall carry 80% weightage to Quality Score and 20% weightage to Price Bid. Thereby, the Bidder with the highest score on Quality and Cost based (QCBS) evaluation will qualify as the Successful Bidder.

1.5 Combined Quality and Price Bid Evaluation
For all the qualified bidders whose price bid have been opened, a combined score (S) shall be determined by according 20% weightage to total price bid score and 80% weightage to the Quality score, as per the following formula:
Combined score S of a bidder A = 80 %\* (Quality Score of A) + 20% \* ((Lowest Total Price Bid) / (Total Price Bid of A))\*100
On basis of the above combined score, the bidder shall be ranked in terms of the combined score obtained. The bidder with the highest combined score (H-1) shall be declared successful.
Quality and total price bid evaluation process has been illustrated in the table below:
- Quality Score (Q) of individual bidder after presentation to evaluation committee.
- Total Price bid (P) opened for bidders getting qualifying marks in the Quality Score evaluation
- Relative total price bid score of all the bidders getting qualifying Quality Score
- Final calculation of Quality and total price bid score (S) of all the bidders getting qualifying quality score
XYZ did not get qualifying Quality Score as it has not scored 70 marks (column (i)). Hence his price bid has not opened and he was not considered for further evaluation. DEF and GHI are not the highest combined score (i.e. Quality score + total price bid score) bidders and hence not selected.
ABC is the highest combined scorer (H-1) bidder and would be selected as the successful bidder.
In case the combined score of two (2) or more bidders is exactly same, then the bidder with the highest Quality score would be considered as the successful bidder.
BPCL reserves the right to negotiate the commercials with the said successful bidder. Thereafter BPCL will follow internal procedure for necessary approvals and proceed with notification of award of the contract.
