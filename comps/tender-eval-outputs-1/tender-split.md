The price bid score of a bidder will be relative to the lowest price bid of all the bidders whose price bid have been opened.

## 1.5 Combined Quality and Price Bid Evaluation

For all the qualified bidders whose price bid have been opened, a combined score (S) shall be determined by according 20% weightage to total price bid score and 80% weightage to the Quality score, as per the following formula:

Combined score S of a bidder A = 80 %\* (Quality Score of A) + 20% \* ((Lowest Total Price Bid) / (Total Price Bid of A))\*100

On basis of the above combined score, the bidder shall be ranked in terms of the combined score obtained. The bidder with the highest combined score (H-1) shall be declared successful.

Quality and total price bid evaluation process has been illustrated in the table below:

- Quality Score (Q) of individual bidder after presentation to evaluation committee.
- Total Price bid (P) opened for bidders getting qualifying marks in the Quality Score evaluation
- Relative total price bid score of all the bidders getting qualifying Quality Score
- Final calculation of Quality and total price bid score (S) of all the bidders getting qualifying quality score

XYZ did not get qualifying Quality Score as it has not scored 70 marks (column (i)). Hence his price bid has not opened and he was not considered for further evaluation. DEF and GHI are not the highest combined score (i.e. Quality score + total price bid score) bidders and hence not selected.

ABC is the highest combined scorer (H-1) bidder and would be selected as the successful bidder.

In case the combined score of two (2) or more bidders is exactly same, then the bidder with the highest Quality score would be considered as the successful bidder.

BPCL reserves the right to negotiate the commercials with the said successful bidder. Thereafter BPCL will follow internal procedure for necessary approvals and proceed with notification of award of the contract.
