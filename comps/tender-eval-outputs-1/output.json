Hence his price bid has not opened and he was not considered for further evaluation. DEF and GHI are not the highest combined score (i.e. Quality score + total price bid score) bidders and hence not selected.\nABC is the highest combined scorer (H-1) bidder and would be selected as the successful bidder.\nIn case the combined score of two (2) or more bidders is exactly same, then the bidder with the highest Quality score would be considered as the successful bidder.\nBPCL reserves the right to negotiate the commercials with the said successful bidder.
